# Content-Based-Spam-Email-Detection

Till now, we are able to distinguish whether an email is ham or spam based on its content

Inside the .ipynb_checkpoints folder there's our code.
Inside the email folder, there's a dataset which contains both ham and spam emails

We are focusing on designing and implementing GUI, evaluation measure for spam filters

Update: 12th May,2020
Here we have connected our code (which is shown as Email-Spam.ipynb) with GUI using Tkinter.
Output of detecting ham and spam are shown through captured screenshots as GUI-Output1.png, GUI-Output2.png, GUI-Output3.png.

Note: Email-Spam.ipynb which is present outside the folder Spam Email Detection is the updated code where we have connected GUI and the Folder Spam Email Detection also consists of Email-Spam.ipynb which is the previous code in which we have not connected GUI
